# Ben's UI mockups

Update: 2021-01-15

Ben made these several years ago. Updating today to make them usable out of the box.

See them rendered with just

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

from this directory. It'll render `index.html` when you browse to <http://localhost:8000>.
You can see `munge.html` by browsing to <http://localhost:8000/munge.html>.

I've also included screenshots in the screenshots/ directory.
